  ## Install

  We use both npm and bower, respectively for the gulp dependencies (+ eggshell) and 3rd party JS:

      npm install

  You also may need to install the `githug-pages` gem:

      sudo gem install github-pages

  ## Build Jekyll

     jekyll serve

  ## run & Build

  You'll need to build the JS and CSS:

      npm start

  localhost:3000
