  ## Install

  We use both npm and bower, respectively for the gulp dependencies (+ eggshell) and 3rd party JS:

      npm install

  You also may need to install the `githug-pages` gem:

      gem install github-pages

  ## run & Build

  You'll need to build the JS and CSS:

      npm run gulp

  Open `localhost:3000` in the browser.
